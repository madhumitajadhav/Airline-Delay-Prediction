# Airline-Delay-Prediction

Aim: To Predict the weather delay of flights based on its atmosphearic conditions such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, Gust Speed, Events like snowfall,,rain, thunderstorms etc. 

This project helped to predict the weather delays and its duration of delay using algorithms like random forest, GBM and Logestic regression.
